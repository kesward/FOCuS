# Poisson-FOCuS: An efficient online method for detecting count bursts with application to gamma ray burst detection

This is the repository for the JASA paper submission Ward et. al, [2022](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2208.01494). The repository is structured as follows:

**algorithms**: Python implementations of the FOCuS algorithm for both Poisson (as described in the paper) and Gaussian cases. Note that the "fast" versions of the algorithms rely on work from a later paper (Ward et al, [2023](
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2302.04743)) and go beyond the scope of the journal submission. They are included here to hopefully be of use to practitioners.

**plots**: Image files used within the paper. The README file renders these in order produced in the paper and gives brief descriptions of each plot and where it was created.

**plot-creation**: Reproducibility workflows for plots in the plots folder.

This code repository has been anonymised to comply with journal submission requirements.
