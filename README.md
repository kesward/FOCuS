# FOCuS
Functional Online Cumulative Sum

The FOCuS algorithms in this repository is suitable for the Gaussian or Poisson cases. An additional 'faster' algorithm working primarily with curve differences is also under investigation/construction. The sourcing of plots for the FOCuS paper can be replicated via the notebooks in the main folder (with exception of the simulated lightcurves as that requires too much hosting of data on the repository).
